## IOT-Task-2-Serial-Communication

The Second task for the IOT department is to make Serial Communication with two Arduino. The first Arduino is connected to the LED and the other Arduino is connected to the button. The simulation has been done using TinkerCAD.

 For example, if the button is pushed, the LED will turn ON.
